## Problems Solved

Below is a list of the HackerRank challenges I have tackled, along with a brief description of each and a link to the original problem statement.

### 1. Solve Me First

* **Description**: This challenge serves as a basic introduction to HackerRank's environment. The task is straightforward: read two integers from standard input and print their sum to standard output. It's designed to get you familiar with input/output operations.

### 2. Simple Array Sum

* **Description**: In this problem, you are given an array of integers. Your objective is to calculate and return the sum of all its elements.

### 3. Compare the Triplets

* **Description**: Alice and Bob have each created a problem for HackerRank. A reviewer evaluates their challenges based on three criteria. Your task is to compare their scores in each of these three categories and determine a comparison point for Alice and Bob. For each category, if one person scores higher, they get 1 point; if it's a tie, no one gets a point.

### 4. A Very Big Sum

* **Description**: This challenge asks you to compute the sum of elements in an array. The catch is that some of the integers in the array might be quite large, potentially exceeding the capacity of standard 32-bit integers. You need to use a data type that can handle such large numbers.

### 5. Plus Minus

* **Description**: Given an array of integers, you need to calculate and print the ratios of its positive, negative, and zero elements. Each ratio should be printed on a new line, formatted to 6 decimal places.

### 6. Staircase

* **Description**: For this problem, you are required to print a staircase of a specified size. The staircase is constructed using `#` symbols and spaces, with its base and height being equal to the given size. It must be right-aligned, meaning the last line should have no leading spaces.
